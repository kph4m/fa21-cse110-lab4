1. Line 9 will print "values added: 20". The result variable will store the sum of num1 and num2 (10 + 10 = 20).

2. Line 13 will print "final result: 20". Since result is a var type, it has a functional scope so it can be accessed anywhere in the function.

3. Line 9 will print "values added: 20". Since the console.log is still within the block that result is declared in, it can still access it's value.

4. Line 13 will return an error. The console.log is outside the block where result was declared in so it cannot access it's value.

5. The code won't be able to execute line 9 because there is an error at line 7. Since result is a const, it cannot be reassigned to the sum of num1 and num2.

6. Similar to question 5, it won't be able to execute line 13 because of the error in line 7, in which const cannot be reassigned to the sum of num1 and num2.
